### CMU 24-655 P4: EE Final Project
##### Rishab Nagori, Nikhila Vembu, Bradley Scammon, Dan Emerson

There are four folders of code needed to run this project.

*Chiron* contains all of the subject data from the JSI dataset provided to us by the instructors.
*In the GITHUB version of this code, the Chiron data is too large to be upoaded. Instead, you must download from the original authors [here](https://dis.ijs.si/ami-repository/datasets/chiron.rar)*

*EE_preprocessing* includes Matlab code for preprocessing of the data, including extrapolation and feature expansion.

*empatica_code* includes Python code to append all of the .csv files containing data from the Empatica wristband from our own group's data collection.

*model_code* includes Python code detailing our model selection and optimization process. Note: there is an additional readme.txt file in this zip with detailed directions about each of the specific python scripts and other files included.
